        <h3>Available Repositories</h3>

        <br />

        <h2><span>&nbsp;</span>Anonymous Git</h2>
        <p>Anonymous Git access is available via GitHub using the
        <tt>git://</tt> protocol.</p>

        <p>To clone a repository, use the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/horde/[REPO]</pre>

        <p>where <tt>REPO</tt> is one of the available repositories listed
        above. The <tt>--depth 1</tt> option creates a <i>shallow</i> clone
        rather than downloading the whole repository; this saves significant
        storage space on your local machine and requires less network bandwidth
        during the initial transfer. The disadvantage is that the full
        repository history will not be available on your local machine, you
        cannot clone or fetch from it, nor push from nor into it (none of these
        activities are generally useful for anonymous repositories anyway). If
        you do want the full repository, simply omit <tt>--depth 1</tt>.</p>

        <p>To update the repository, enter the repository directory and use this
        command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git pull</pre>

        <h3>Making Development Repos Web-Accessible</h3>

        <p>Make sure you have cloned the <tt>horde</tt> repo. Once initialized,
        creating a web-accessible development installation can be done simply
        by running the <tt>install_dev</tt> PHP script located at
        <tt>horde-git/framework/bin</tt>. To properly run this script, the
        <tt>Horde_Role</tt> package must be installed and a local copy of
        install_dev.conf must be created on your system, with the variables
        inside that file edited as necessary to apply to your system.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        pear channel-discover pear.horde.org
        pear install horde/horde_role
        cd /path/to/horde-git/framework/bin
        cp install_dev.conf.dist install_dev.conf
        vi install_dev.conf (replace vi with your favorite editing tool)
        ./install_dev
        </pre>

        <p>Running that script will symlink the entire horde package into the
        web-accessible directory you specified in <tt>install_dev.conf</tt>,
        symlink all other Horde applications within that directory, and will
        properly set up the necessary include/horde path definitions. Note that
        all edits should take place within the repository, as the
        web-accessible directory will be deleted every time
        the <tt>install_dev</tt> script is run.</p>

        <p>Full directory paths will be needed in
        <tt>horde-git/horde/config/registry.php</tt> due to the symlinks. The
        easiest way to setup full paths is to set the <tt>$app_fileroot</tt>
        parameter in this file.</p>

        <p>Note that unlike a PEAR install, the <tt>Autoloader_Cache</tt>
        package will be enabled by default. If you attempt to use Horde or load
        the test.php page before all PEAR dependencies are installed, you will
        have to purge the autoloader cache.</p>

        <p>You can now follow the procedures in the normal <?php echo
        $this->linkTo('INSTALL', array('controller' => 'app', 'action' =>
        'docs/INSTALL', 'app' => 'horde'))?> document to complete the
        configuration and database creation.</p>

        <p>If, after you have configured Horde, you wish you can manually run
        the database migrations, you can run these from the checkout directory
        as so:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">./horde/bin/horde-db-migrate [application_name [up|down]]</pre>

        <p>If installing the framework libraries directly via PEAR, i.e. not
        with with <tt>install_dev</tt>, you will need to define your horde
        application directory (i.e. the filesystem directory where the Horde
        application is installed and accessible to a browser) in your PEAR
        config.  This can be done with the horde/Role package previously
        installed on your system via:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        pear run-scripts horde/Horde_Role
        </pre>

        <h3 id="patch">Creating Patches</h3>

        <p>To submit patches, first make the changes in your local
        repository. You will need to <a href="#createcommit">commit these
        changes locally</a>.  After committing, use the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git format-patch -M -B origin</pre>

        <p>This command creates a separate patch file for each commit that
        exists locally on your machine but does not exist in the master Horde
        branch (origin).  These patch files will be located in your local
        directory.</p>

        <h2><span>&nbsp;</span>Developer Git</h2>

        <p>Access to the live Git repository is only available over SSH. You
        will want to create an SSH key and use that with your account on
        dev.horde.org to avoid having to enter your password on every
        pull/push.</p>

        <p>You will also need to create an account on GitHub as the master repo
        will
        be <a href="http://lists.horde.org/archives/dev/Week-of-Mon-20100830/025224.html">mirrored
        to GitHub every time a commit is pushed</a>.  The following needs to be
        done:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Create a GitHub account.</li>
            <li><a href="https://web-horde.org/w/help.github.com/linux-key-setup/">Setup your
            SSH public key</a>. This SSH key must exist in your github.com
            account.</li>
            <li><a href="http://lists.horde.org/archives/dev/Week-of-Mon-20100830/025226.html">Make
            sure the github host key is stored in your git.horde.org
            account</a>.</li>
            <li>Join the Horde organization on GitHub (send e-mail to core@lists.horde.org).</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Cloning repository</h3>

        <p>To clone a repository, use this command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git clone ssh://dev.horde.org/horde/git/[REPO]</pre>

        <p>where <tt>REPO</tt> is one of the available repositories listed
        above.</p>

        <p>This will create a <tt>REPO</tt> directory in your current
        directory.  Once completed, an up to date copy of the master Git
        repository will be available on your system. You must use the SSH
        protocol rather than the git protocol because the Horde Git repository
        only supports pushing commits through SSH. (Since Git will
        automatically use the protocol used to clone the repository for all
        future push/pull operations, it is easiest to set your local repository
        up correctly from the beginning.)</p>


        <h3>Updating repository</h3>

        <p>To update your local repository, <span style="color:red">you MUST
        rebase the changes on top of your local repo copy. Failure to do so
        will result in useless, annoying commit merge messages both added to
        the master repository and sent in the commit e-mails.</span></p>

        <p>To update/rebase the changes, you can use the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git pull --rebase</pre>

        <p>Better still, to prevent an unnecessary merge, you can configure
        <tt><a href="https://web-horde.org/w/kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html">git
        pull</a></tt> to always rebase when pulling for a particular repo by
        using the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git config branch.[reponame].rebase true</pre>

        <p>One disadvantage of <tt>git pull</tt> is that (as of Git v1.6.1.1)
        it does not indicate which files are updated. To see a list of files
        that are updated, you should run these two commands instead:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        git fetch
        git rebase -v origin
        </pre>

        <p>A helpful alias for <pre class="brush:bash">.gitconfig</pre> to
        update your local repository while seeing changed files and avoiding
        conflicts is:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        [alias]
            get = !BRANCH=$(git branch -vv | grep ^\\* | sed -E 's/^[^[]+\\[([^]:]+).+$/\\1/') &&
                git fetch &&
                ( git rebase -v $BRANCH ||
                    ( git stash &&
                        ( git rebase -v $BRANCH ||
                          echo "WARNING: Run 'git stash pop' manually!" ) &&
                      git stash pop ) )
        </pre>

        <p>For more information on rebasing, and the commands needed if
        conflicts are detected during the rebase/merge, see:
        <a href="https://web-horde.org/w/kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#using-git-rebase">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#using-git-rebase</a>
        and <a href="https://web-horde.org/w/jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/2007/01/26/git-rebase-keeping-your-branches-current/">http://jbowes.dangerouslyinc.com/2007/01/26/git-rebase-keeping-your-branches-current/</a>.</p>


        <h3 id="createcommit">Creating commits</h3>

        <p>First, you should make sure your contact information is correct. The
        easiest way to do so is to issue the following commands:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        git config user.name "FirstName LastName"
        git config user.email "user@example.com"
        </pre>

        <p>Go ahead and hack away. When finished, commit the files to your
        local repo. There are several ways to do this. To add specific files to
        a commit, use the following commands:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        git add filename [filename2] [filename3...]
        git commit
        </pre>

        <p><tt><a href="https://web-horde.org/w/kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html">git
        add</a></tt> has many powerful tools to indicate what files or portions
        of a file you want to commit: the <tt>-i</tt> option (interactive
        mode), and
        <tt>-p</tt> option (patch mode) are good examples. Read the man page for
        further information on these options (and others).</p>

        <p>You can also list the files to be committed on the command line to
        commit:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git commit [filename1] [filename2] ... [filenameX]</pre>

        <p>If you want to commit all modified files, you can use the following
        shortcut command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git commit -a</pre>

        <p>If you want to commit all modified files, and want a shortcut to
        also specify the commit message on the command line, use the following
        command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git commit -a -m "[commit message]"</pre>

        <h3>Pushing commits</h3>

        <p>Once you finish with your local commits and want to push them to the
        master repository, use the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git push</pre>

        <p>When pushing, it is most likely the desired action to ONLY push
        changes to branches that are currently being tracked on the master
        server. This is the default git behavior, but the following config
        verifies that the setting is configured properly:

        <pre class="brush:bash">git config push.default matching</pre>

        <h3>Stashing</h3>

        <p>Say you are working in a git tree and have previously made some
        local commits. You then started working on other code and modified
        several other files. However, you then decide you want to push the
        previously made commits to the central repository (e.g. those commits
        fix a critical bug). However, git will not let you push your commits
        because your tree is not clean.</p>

        <p>In the absence of originally using a branch to do the newer hacking,
        you can easily create a temporary branch, move the work-in-progress to
        the temporary branch, push your commits to the server, and then
        re-apply your work-in-progress to the current branch. Git has a
        wonderful built-in command that will do all this work for you:
        <tt><a href="https://web-horde.org/w/kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">stash</a></tt>.
        To stash all work-in-progress on the current tree, use:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git stash</pre>

        <p>When you need to pull the changes back, use:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git stash apply</pre>

        <p>Stash has many more features that won't be explained here - check the
        documentation (e.g. working with multiple stashes, popping a stash).</p>

        <h3>Combining commits</h3>

        <p>It may often happen that you have many local commits that you want
        to push to the central repository. It may often be that many of these
        changes are similar (i.e. nits/doc cleanup/whitespace) or that some of
        the commits fixed things caused by a previous local, non-pushed,
        commit. In this case, it may be better to clean up the commit list to
        make the ultimate project history and commit notification e-mails look
        nicer. Git provides an easy way to manipulate your local commits:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        # origin means edit all commits applied on top of the last pull
        # from the central repository.
        git rebase -i origin
        </pre>

        <p>Use the 'squash' option to combine multiple commits. Instructions on
        the edit screen explain the various other features.</p>

        <h3>Creating/Managing remote branches</h3>

        <p>It may be useful to share work on a local branch with other
        developers.  For example, a large change that might not yet be ready
        for primetime, but could benefit for some eyeballs, might be useful to
        share on a branch rather than the master repo. To create a branch on
        the master Horde repository, and have your existing topic branch track
        the remove branch, use the following command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git push -u origin [localbranch]</pre>

        <p>Now all users can track this branch by issuing this command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git checkout -t origin/[remote branch name]</pre>

        <p>You should keep the topic branch up to date with the main branch
        during development so that your topic branch only contains the changes
        related to the work being done in the branch:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">
        git checkout [topic]
        git merge master
        # resolve conflicts
        git pull --rebase
        git push
        </pre>

        <p>During a long-lived branch, you will find yourself having to resolve
        the same conflicts over and over again. The git
        tool <em>git-rerere</em> is designed to help alleviate this issue. Once
        it is enabled, it will <strong>automatically</strong> take note of each
        conflict, and it's eventual resolution. Next time git comes across the
        exact same conflict, it will know on it's own how to resolve it. To use
        this feature you must explicitly enable it:</p>
        <pre class="brush:bash">
            git config --global rerere.enabled 1
        </pre>

        <p>To delete the remote branch, issue this command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git push origin :[branchname]</pre>

        <p>To remove stale remote branches from your branch list, issue this
         command:</p>

        <pre class="brush:bash">git remote prune origin</pre>
