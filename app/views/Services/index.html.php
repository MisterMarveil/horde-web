        <h3>Why Horde Groupware?</h3>
        <p>Horde is the most flexible groupware on the planet, and that makes
        it the perfect platform on which to build your business productivity
        software:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Horde connects to (and officially supports) more backends (all
          the leading SQL, LDAP, IMAP, Sieve, SMTP, cache platforms available
          today) than any other open source groupware system.  This means you
          can continue to use your existing userbase and your users do not have
          to remember any additional passwords.</li>
          <li>Data entered in Horde may be updated or consumed via a wide range
          of front-end protocols (HTTP/HTML, DAV, SyncML, ActiveSync,
          iCalendar, more).  Why let your data be siloed?  Horde presents your
          information where you need it.</li>
          <li>Template and CSS-based design makes customization easy.  There
          are nearly unlimited numbers of ways to customize and configure Horde
          to fit almost any need.</li>
          <li>Maturity. Horde's source code goes back over 10 years and
          benefits from years of engineering, bugfixes, security reports
          testing and user feedback.</li>
          <li>Feature-rich. Horde's feature set rivals the largest enterprise
          email systems.  We have an incredible feature set that compares
          favorably against any competition in our primary apps (mail,
          calendar, address book), and even more in our secondary apps (time
          tracking, wiki, ticketing, and more).</li>
          <li>Open Source. Horde is open source, which means there are never
          per-user licensing fees or costly mandatory support contracts.  It
          also means that, if necessary, you can customize any part of Horde at
          any time.</li>
          <li>Active development. Horde benefits from a large and active
          community of developers and users, and continues to add features
          nearly every day.</li>
        </ul>
