  <h2>Mike Hardy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not currently doing more than cutting the releases for Horde and IMP because I
    work at a startup and its deadline time (bleh). I'm enjoying life in The
    City (San Francisco) though, since I just moved there this month</li>
    <li><a href="http://web.horde.to/mikehardy.net">vanity domain</a> so I have
    a stable net presence...</li>
   <li>Since everyone else seems to have the minor personal blurb here, I'm 24, enjoy
   moving at high rates of speed outdoors whenever possible (sportbikes, racing
   bicycles, yadda yadda), and spend the rest of my time (much more
   sensibly) inside, usually watching movies, coding, or just generally being
   fascinated by various aspects of human sociology.</li>
</ul>
