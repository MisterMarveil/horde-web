<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><code>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Hermes Time<br />
Tracking Application version H5 (2.0).<br />
<br />
Hermes is a time tracking and reporting application written for the Horde<br />
Framework. Taking advantage of the Framework for authentication and<br />
presentation, it integrates seamlessly with other Horde applications allowing<br />
users to track time against to do items (from Nag), tickets (from Whups), or<br />
pre-configured projects within Hermes itself. The list of billable clients is<br />
taken from the address book (Turba).<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production<br />
systems. This version is not feature complete yet and there are likely to be<br />
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production data.<br />
<br />
We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug<br />
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings<br />
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.<br />
<br />
Major changes compared to the Hermes H3 (1.0.1) version are:<br />
    * Redesigned UI.<br />
    * Added Ajax view.<br />
    * Added improved support for timers.</code>
