<h3>Release notes for the latest release</h3><code>
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Gollem File<br />
Manager version H5 (3.0.12).<br />
<br />
Gollem is a web-based file manager, providing the ability to fully manage a<br />
hierarchical file system stored in a variety of backends such as a SQL<br />
database, as part of a real filesystem, or on FTP, Samba or SSH servers. For<br />

Thanks to Tim O'Driscoll &lt;tim.odriscoll@lambrookschool.co.uk&gt; for reporting the<br />
missing authorization check for file downloads on backends that don't require<br />
implicit authentication.<br />
<br />
The major changes compared to Gollem version H5 (3.0.11) are:<br />
    * Fixed unauthorized access to file downloads.<br />
    * Officially support PHP 7.</code>
