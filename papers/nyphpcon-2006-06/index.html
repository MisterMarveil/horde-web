<h1>One-day Application Building With The Horde Framework</h1>

<p>This is the talk presented by Chuck Hagenbuch
at <a href="http://www.nyphpcon.com/">NYPHPCon</a> 2006. It is a
tutorial on how to build a real-estate tracking application using
Horde (RDO, Horde_Form, and a few
more), <a
href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a>, <a
href="http://script.aculo.us/">Scriptaculous</a>, and several
mapping/geocoding web services. Because of the code-heavy nature of
the tutorial and the number of examples, the slides are available only
as a tarball. This includes complete source code for 8 versions of the
example application as it progresses from a simple auto-generated table
to the final application.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>

 <li>Download and decompress (bz2) the slides: <a href="nyphpcon-2006-06_v20070201.tar.bz2">nyphpcon-2006-06_v20070201.tar.bz2</a> (292 KB)</li>

 <li>Put the expanded nyphpcon-2006-06/ directory into a subdir (such
 as horde/samples/nyphpcon) in your Horde HEAD installation (you can
 also check Horde out of CVS and then check out the presentations/ CVS
 module under your horde/ directory). <em>Your Horde version must be
 after June 27th for the most recent version of the slides (and vice
 versa), because of RDO being renamed to Horde_RDO.</em></li>

 <li>If you do not follow this layout, you will need to change the
 definition of the HORDE_BASE constants in the example code.</li>

 <li>Create the database. There are example files for MySQL and PostgreSQL.</li>

 <li>Set your database configuration, Yahoo! API key, and Google API key in conf.php (copied from conf.php.dist).</li>

 <li>Load index.html in a browser and follow along!</li>

</ol>

<h3>Changelog</h3>

<p>The code archive now has a date appended to it to indicate when it
was last changed. The code is being kept up to date with Horde API
changes for the time being, so the date indicates when it was last
modified. Changes are listed below according to the version they were
introduced in.</p>

<h4>v20070201</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Updates to work with refactored RDO code in Horde HEAD.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v20070126</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Add a local copy of the Helpers to help with breakage. This also
 means an incubator checkout is no longer required to run this
 code.</li>
 <li>Code has been updated to run cleanly with the latest Horde development version.</li>
</ul>

<h4>v20060918</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Update to match current RDO (renamed to Horde_RDO) and Horde code, including the new exception handler.</li>
